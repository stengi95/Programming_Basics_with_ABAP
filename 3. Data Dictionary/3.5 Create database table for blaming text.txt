Create mandant dependent database table for texts belonging to blaming text IDs. Language dependent.

hint: for the proper structure of the table, search for an example in the system for a table and related text table (e.g. mara-makt, tj02-tj02t)

While creation, select field ID of blaming text and create a foreign key. 
If the field is properly entered, the foreign key has to be proposed by the system.
